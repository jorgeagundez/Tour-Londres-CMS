CMS proposal by Symfony 2
=========================

This is a CMS proposal for tour guide company in London.

Is developed by Symfony2 (https://symfony.com/) and it gives to the admin the control to manage all content of the website (tours, prices, banners and so on).

Currently it is under development.
